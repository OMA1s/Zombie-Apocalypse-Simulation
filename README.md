# Zombie-Apocalypse-Simulation
Simulated a Zombie Apocalypse where Zombies chase Humans and Humans flee from Zombies. 
Copy Paste and Run the code on http://www.codeskulptor.org/, then place the zombies and humans on the grid, then click buttons to simulate the behavior. GUI was provided to me, I implemented the simulation. The code of simulation is in this repository.
